# ⭐ About Game of Thrones
Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. It premiered on HBO in the United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.

In this project we will utilize EDA to explore the Game of thrones dataset for:

1. **Which season has the highest ratings?**

2. **Top 5 most viewed**

3. **Top 5 people who work with the most**
